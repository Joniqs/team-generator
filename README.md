## Usage/Examples

Once you run a program you will be prompted to give details about your employees.
You can generate manager, engineer and interns. Once you don't want to add more employees choose option "Finish building the team" and then team.html file with your employee details will be generated in "Output" folder. Open your file and you will be presented with employees details.
